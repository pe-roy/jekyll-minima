## ***Polonius’ Advice to Laertes*** ##

<p><br>
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!<br>
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, <br>
And you are stay’d for. There; my blessing with thee! <br>
And these few precepts in thy memory <br>
–––<br>
<b>See thou character</b>. Give thy thoughts <b>no tongue</b>, <br>
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.<br>
Be thou familiar, but by <b>no means vulgar</b>. <br>
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, <br>
<b>Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;</b> <br>
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment <br>
Of each new-hatch’d, unfledged comrade. Beware <br>
Of <b>entrance to a quarrel</b>, but being in, <br>
Bear’t that the opposed <b>may beware of thee.</b> <br>
–––<br>
Give <b>every man thy ear, but few thy voice;</b> <br>
Take <b>each man’s censure</b>, but reserve <b>thy judgment.</b> <br>
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br>
But not express’d in fancy; <b>rich, not gaudy; </b><br>
For the apparel oft proclaims the man, <br>
And they in France of the best rank and station <br>
Are of a most select and generous chief in that. <br>
–––<br>
<b>Neither a borrower nor a lender be</b>; <br>
For loan oft <b>loses both itself and friend</b>, <br>
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. <br>
–––<br>
This above all: to thine ownself be true, <br>
<b>And it must follow, as the night the day,</b> <br>
<b>Thou canst not then be false to any man.</b> <br>
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee! <br>
