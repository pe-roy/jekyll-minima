<p>Go placidly amid the <b>noise and haste</b>,<br>
and remember what peace there may be <b>in silence</b>.<br>
As far as possible without surrender<br>
be <b>on good terms</b> with all persons.<br>
Speak your <b>truth quietly and clearly</b>;<br>
and listen to others,<br>
even the <b>dull and the ignorant</b>;<br>
they too have their story.<br></p>
<p></p>
<p>Avoid <b>loud and aggressive</b> persons,<br>
they are vexations to the spirit.<br>
If you compare yourself with others,<br>
you may become <b>vain and bitter</b>;<br>
for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.<br>
Enjoy your <b>achievements as well as your plans</b>.<br></p>
<p></p>
<p>Keep interested in your own career, however <b>humble</b>;<br>
it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.<br>
Exercise <b>caution</b> in your business affairs;<br>
for the world is full of trickery.<br>
But let this not blind you to what <b>virtue</b> there is;<br>
many persons <b>strive for high ideals</b>;<br>
and everywhere life is full of heroism.<br></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Be yourself</b>.<br>
Especially, do not feign affection.<br>
Neither be cynical about love;<br>
for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment<br>
it is as <b>perennial as the grass</b>.<br></p>
<p></p>
<p>Take kindly the counsel of <b>the years</b>,<br>
gracefully surrendering the things <b>of youth</b>.<br>
Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.<br>
But do not <b>distress yourself</b> with dark imaginings.<br>
Many fears are born of fatigue and <b>loneliness</b>.<br>
Beyond a wholesome discipline,<br>
be gentle <b>with yourself</b>.<br></p>
<p></p>
<p>You are a child of the universe,<br>
no less than the <b>trees and the stars</b>;<br>
you have a right to be here.<br>
And whether or not it is clear to you,<br>
no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.<br></p>
<p></p>
<p>Therefore be at <b>peace with God</b>,<br>
whatever you conceive Him to be,<br>
and whatever your labors and aspirations,<br>
in the noisy confusion of life <b>keep peace with your soul</b>.<br></p>
<p></p>
<p>With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams,<br>
it is still a <b>beautiful world</b>.<br>
Be cheerful.<br>
<b>Strive to be happy</b>.<br></p>
