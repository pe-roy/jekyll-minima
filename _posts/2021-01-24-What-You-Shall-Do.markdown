<b>This is what you shall do;</b><br>
<b>Love</b> the earth and sun and the animals,<br> 
despise riches, give alms ​​to every one that asks, <br>
<b>stand up</b> for the stupid and crazy, <br>
devote your income and labor to ​​others, <br>
<b>hate tyrants</b>, <br>
<br>
argue not concerning God, <br>
<b>have patience and indulgence</b> toward the ​​​people, <br>
take off your hat to nothing known or unknown <br>
or to any man or number of men, <br>
<br>
go ​​freely with powerful uneducated persons <br>
and with the young and with the mothers of ​​​families, <br>
read these leaves in the open air <br>
every season of every year of your life, <br>
<b>re-examine ​all</b> you have been told <br>
<b>at school or church or in any book</b>,<br> 
<br>
dismiss whatever insults your own ​soul, <br>
and your very flesh <b>shall be a great poem</b> <br>
and have the richest fluency not only in its ​​words <br>
but in <b>the silent lines</b> of its lips and face <br>
and between the lashes of your eyes <br>
and in ​​<b>every motion and joint</b> of your body.<br></p>
